#Arrays
Arrays different problem statement implementations with best possible complexity constraint.

Minimum difference between any two numbers of a given list.
Only for this we actually need to sort the array to procees any further hence we need O(nlogn)
Apart from this all other questions are pinned down to linear complexity.
